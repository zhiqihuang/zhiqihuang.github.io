Hi, I am an Applied Researcher at Capital One. I completed my Ph.D. under the mentorship of my advisor, Prof. [James Allan](https://www.cs.umass.edu/~allan), at the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval ([CIIR](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/)), Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research endeavors lie at the intersection of information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning (IR/NLP/ML).

I received my master's in Statistics from the University of Maryland, College Park, and my bachelor's in Applied Math from Sun Yat-sen University.
